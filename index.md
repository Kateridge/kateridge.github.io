## About Me

I’m a 1st year PhD student at University of Pennsylvania, supervised by Prof. Yong Fan. Previously, I received my Master's degrees in Computer Science and Technology from ShanghaiTech University, supevised by Prof. Dinggang Shen.

My research interests include medical image analysis and computer-aided diagnosis. I mainly work on multimodal fusion for brain disease diganosis and image-to-image translation for medical image in the past two years.
